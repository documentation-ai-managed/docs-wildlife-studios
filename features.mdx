## Advanced Search Filters and Operators

You perform precise legal research using advanced filters like date ranges, jurisdictions, and citation counts. Combine them with Boolean operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) and phrase searches for targeted results.

    Use standard operators for complex queries.

    <CodeGroup tabs="Query Examples">
      ```lucene
      contract AND dispute AND california
      ```
      ```lucene
      "non-compete agreement" OR "restrictive covenant"
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

  <Tab title="Filters" icon="filter">
